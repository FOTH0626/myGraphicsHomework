this is a graphics experiment from my CG lesson  
you can go to [tinyrenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer) and the [GAMES101](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1X7411F744) 's homework to see the code I learn from.  

I need to draw the map.  
you can also draw it by yourself 

``` CMAKE
mkdir build 
cd build 
cmake ..
make 
```
and then you can see the image in the  folder which is named `chinaMap.tga` and `cohenSutherland.tga`

By the way ,i don'tthink my graphics lesson is acceptable.  
there's no **rendering pipeline** , no **linear algebra** even the mvp transform , no **rasterisation** .  
No theoretical teaching, only practical methods.  
I bet that more than 90% ,even 95%,student in this lesson dont know how the gpu work and the data become images(the render pipeline).
